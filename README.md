Trying to learn html canvas drawing


## Synopsis

At the top of the file there should be a short introduction and/ or overview that explains **what** the project is. This description should match descriptions added for package managers (Gemspec, package.json, etc.)

## Code Example

Pending

## Motivation

I need to learn how to make HTML5 Canvas apps, jQuery, Angular and generally learn how to make web-apps

## Installation

NA

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.
Really need to get a test framework shoehorned in here. Thinking Jasmine from Angular-Seed, but with less bullshit
